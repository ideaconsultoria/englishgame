            <p><strong>Alex:</strong> Hi Ben! It's great to see you again. How <em>are you doing</em> today? You <em>look</em> a bit busy, as usual!</p>
            <p><strong>Ben:</strong> Hi Alex! Good to see you too! I'm doing well, thanks. Yes, I <strong>am working</strong> on a tight deadline for a new substation project, so I <strong>am feeling</strong> a little stressed, but it's exciting! We <strong>are trying</strong> to get everything finalized before the end of the month. And you? How <strong>are things going</strong> with you?</p>
            <p><strong>Alex:</strong> I'm good, thanks! I <strong>am currently reviewing</strong> some network upgrade proposals for a big client. It’s always something new and fast-paced in telecom, isn't it? So, tell me, what <strong>are you working on</strong> these days? What <strong>is your role</strong> as a project analyst in electric projects? I know the basics, but tell me more.</p>
            <p><strong>Ben:</strong> Well, you know I <strong>manage</strong> the lifecycle of electrical infrastructure projects. This usually <strong>involves</strong> planning, executing, and closing projects. I <strong>work</strong> closely with engineers and contractors. My main responsibility <strong>is to ensure</strong> that projects stay on schedule and within budget. I also <strong>deal</strong> with a lot of regulatory compliance. It <strong>is</strong> a lot of paperwork!</p>
            <p><strong>Alex:</strong> It sounds quite complex, indeed! What kind of personal characteristics <strong>do you think</strong> are most important for your job? I remember we talked about this briefly last time.</p>
            <p><strong>Ben:</strong> I believe strong organizational skills <strong>are essential</strong>, and you definitely <strong>need</strong> to be detail-oriented. Problem-solving abilities <strong>are</strong> also crucial, because unexpected issues <strong>always come up</strong>. And, of course, good communication <strong>helps</strong> a lot when you <strong>are coordinating</strong> different teams. What about you? What <strong>do you find</strong> important in your role?</p>
            <p><strong>Alex:</strong> I totally agree! Communication <strong>is key</strong> in my role too. I <strong>am responsible for</strong> telecom projects, primarily focusing on fiber optic deployments and 5G network expansions. I <strong>live</strong> in Rio de Janeiro, and our main office <strong>is located</strong> downtown. My family <strong>lives</strong> here too. Where <strong>do you live</strong> these days? Are you still in São Paulo?</p>
            <p><strong>Ben:</strong> Yes, I <strong>live</strong> in São Paulo. It’s a very dynamic city, much like Rio, but with its own unique energy. My office <strong>is</strong> in the industrial district here. My parents <strong>visit</strong> me often, as they <strong>live</strong> in a smaller town nearby. What <strong>do you like</strong> most about living in Rio? I remember you <strong>love</strong> the beaches.</p>
            <p><strong>Alex:</strong> Oh, I <strong>love</strong> the beaches and the vibrant culture! I often <strong>go</strong> for a run along Copacabana beach in the mornings. The weather <strong>is usually</strong> sunny. Right now, I <strong>am planning</strong> a trip to the Christ the Redeemer statue with some friends who <strong>are visiting</strong> next week. They <strong>are coming</strong> from Europe for the first time. What <strong>do you like</strong> to do in your free time in São Paulo? Are you still playing football?</p>
            <p><strong>Ben:</strong> I <strong>enjoy</strong> exploring new restaurants and art galleries. São Paulo <strong>has</strong> an incredible food scene. This weekend, I <strong>am trying</strong> a new Japanese fusion place that just opened. Yes, I also <strong>play</strong> football with a group of friends every Saturday. We <strong>are currently practicing</strong> for a local tournament, so we <strong>are meeting</strong> twice a week now. It <strong>is</strong> a lot of fun!</p>
            <p><strong>Alex:</strong> That sounds great! So, regarding your work routine, what <strong>does a typical day look like</strong> for you now? Has anything changed since we last spoke?</p>
            <p><strong>Ben:</strong> A typical day still <strong>starts</strong> with checking emails and project dashboards. I usually <strong>have</strong> a stand-up meeting with my team around 9 AM. After that, I <strong>spend</strong> a lot of time reviewing progress reports, updating schedules, and communicating with stakeholders. This afternoon, for example, I <strong>am preparing</strong> a presentation for the board about the new substation project. My boss <strong>is expecting</strong> it by 5 PM.</p>
            <p><strong>Alex:</strong> My routine <strong>is</strong> quite similar! I also <strong>start</strong> with emails. Then, I often <strong>attend</strong> virtual meetings with clients or vendors. Today, I <strong>am participating</strong> in a workshop on new cybersecurity protocols for our 5G infrastructure. It <strong>is getting</strong> more and more complex! I <strong>am always learning</strong> something new, which I <strong>like</strong>.</p>
            <p><strong>Ben:</strong> Exactly! It <strong>is</strong> a field where you <strong>are constantly adapting</strong>. What <strong>do you dislike</strong> about your job, if anything? I know every job <strong>has</strong> its challenges.</p>
            <p><strong>Alex:</strong> Sometimes, the bureaucratic processes <strong>can be</strong> a bit frustrating, and the long hours <strong>are</strong> challenging, especially when a project <strong>is facing</strong> delays. But overall, I <strong>am enjoying</strong> the challenges and the opportunity to work with cutting-edge technology. My team <strong>is working</strong> very hard right now on a new initiative, and we <strong>are making</strong> good progress. And you?</p>
            <p><strong>Ben:</strong> I sometimes <strong>find</strong> the sheer volume of regulations overwhelming, and sometimes, unexpected site issues <strong>are causing</strong> significant delays, which <strong>is</strong> tough. But the satisfaction of seeing a critical infrastructure project completed <strong>makes</strong> it all worthwhile. We <strong>are currently celebrating</strong> the completion of a major power line upgrade.</p>
            <p><strong>Alex:</strong> I completely understand that feeling! It was great catching up, Ben. I <strong>have</strong> to jump to another meeting now. My next call <strong>is starting</strong> in five minutes.</p>
            <p><strong>Ben:</strong> You too, Alex! Good luck with your projects and enjoy your friends' visit!</p>
